    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplicity, let's start with the almost the simplest possible consumption model: a problem in which the consumer has perfect foresight about everything except the date of death, which is stochastic (this is captured by a \"survival probability\" $\\mathsf{D} < 1$).  Income $Y_t$ grows from period to period by a factor $\\Gamma_t$.  Each period $t$, he must choose how much of his market resources $M_t$ to consume $C_t$ and how much to retain in a riskless asset $A_t$ with return factor $R$. The agent receives a flow of utility $U(C_t)$ from consumption (with CRRA preferences) and geometrically discounts future utility flows by factor $\\beta$. Between periods, the agent dies with probability $\\mathsf{D}_t$, ending his problem.\n",
