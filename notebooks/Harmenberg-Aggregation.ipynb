    "In macroeconomic models with heterogeneous agents, the permanent component of agents' income ($\\textbf{P}_t$) often follows a geometric random walk. At any time, these economies include agents with different levels of permanent income. To find an aggregate characteristic of these economies such as aggregate consumption $\\bar{\\textbf{C}}_t$, one must integrate over permanent income and all the other relevant state variables\n",

    "where $\\text{State}$ denotes any other state variables that consumption might depend on, $C(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is the individual consumption function, and $f_t(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is the joint density function of permanent income and the other state variables at time $t$.\n",
    "\n",

    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this implies that one can defined a normalized state vector $\\widetilde{\\text{State}} = \\text{State}/\\textbf{P}$ and solve for the normalized policy function. This eliminates one dimension of the optimization problem problem, $\\textbf{P}$.\n",
