# # Lucas Pricing of AR1 trees
#
# ## A notebook by [Christopher D. Carroll](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/) and [Mateo VelÃ¡squez-Giraldo](https://mv77.github.io/)
# ### Inspired by its [Quantecon counterpart](https://julia.quantecon.org/multi_agent_models/lucas_model.html)
#
# This notebook presents simple computational tools to solve Lucas' asset-pricing model when the logarithm of the asset's dividend follows an autoregressive process of order 1,
#
# \begin{equation*}
# \ln d_{t+1} = \alpha \ln d_t + \varepsilon_{t+1}.
# \end{equation*}
#
# A presentation of this model can be found in [Christopher D. Carroll's lecture notes](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/public/lecturenotes/AssetPricing/LucasAssetPrice/). 
#
# Those notes [derive](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/public/lecturenotes/AssetPricing/LucasAssetPrice/#pofc) from the Bellman equation a relationship between the price of the asset in the current period $t$ and the next period $t+1$:  
#
# \begin{equation*}
# P_{t} = 
# \overbrace{\left(\frac{1}{1+\theta}\right)}
# ^{\beta}\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[ \frac{u^{\prime}(d_{t+1})}{u^{\prime}(d_t)} (P_{t+1} + d_{t+1}) \right]
# \end{equation*}
#
# The equilibrium pricing equation is a relationship between prices and dividend (a "pricing kernel") $P^{*}(d)$ such that, if everyone _believes_ that to be the pricing kernel, everyone's Euler equation will be satisfied:
#
# \begin{equation*}
# P^*(d_t) = \left(\frac{1}{1+\theta}\right)\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[ \frac{u^{\prime}(d_{t+1})}{u^{\prime}(d_t)} (P^*(d_{t+1}) + d_{t+1}) \right]
# \end{equation*}
#
# As noted in the handout, there are some special circumstances in which it is possible to solve for $P^{*}$ analytically:
#
# | Process | CRRA | Solution for Pricing Kernel | 
# | --- | --- | --- |
# | IID | 1 (log) | $P^*(d) = \frac{d}{\theta}$ |
# | IID | $\rho$ | $P^*(d) \approx \frac{d^\rho}{\theta-\rho(\rho-1)\sigma^{2}/2}$ |
#
# However, under less special circumstances, the only way to obtain the pricing function $P^{*}$ is by solving for it numerically, as below.

# # Creating and solving an example economy
#
# An economy is fully specified by:
# - **The dividend process for the assets (trees)**: we assume that $\ln d_{t+1} = \alpha \ln d_t + \varepsilon_{t+1}$. We must create a dividend process specifying $\alpha$ and $\sigma_{\varepsilon}$.
# - **The coefficient of relative risk aversion (CRRA).**
# - **The time-discount factor ($\beta$).**

# %% Example
# Create a log-AR1 process for dividends
DivProc = DivProcess(alpha = 0.90, shock_sd = 0.1)

# Create an example economy
economy = LucasEconomy(CRRA = 2, DiscFac = 0.95, DivProcess = DivProc)


# %% [markdown]
# Once created, the economy can be 'solved', which means finding the equilibrium price kernel. The distribution of dividends at period $t+1$ depends on the value of dividends at $t$, which also determines the resources agents have available to buy trees. Thus, $d_t$ is a state variable for the economy. The pricing function gives the price of trees that equates their demand and supply at every level of current dividends $d_t$.

# %% Solution
# Solve the economy
economy.solve(disp = True)

# After the economy is solved, we can use its Equilibrium price function
d = 1
print('P({}) = {}'.format(d, economy.EqPfun(d)))


# %% [markdown]
# ## The effect of risk aversion.
#
# [The notes](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/public/lecturenotes/AssetPricing/LucasAssetPrice/) discuss the surprising implication that an increase in the coefficient of relative risk aversion $\rho$ leads to higher prices for the risky trees! This is demonstrated below.

# %%
# Create two economies with different risk aversion
Disc = 0.95
LowCrraEcon  = LucasEconomy(CRRA = 2, DiscFac = Disc, DivProcess = DivProc)
HighCrraEcon = LucasEconomy(CRRA = 4, DiscFac = Disc, DivProcess = DivProc)

# Solve both
LowCrraEcon.solve()
HighCrraEcon.solve()

# Plot the pricing functions for both
dGrid = np.linspace(0.5,2.5,30)
plt.plot(dGrid, LowCrraEcon.EqPfun(dGrid), label = 'Low CRRA')
plt.plot(dGrid, HighCrraEcon.EqPfun(dGrid), label = 'High CRRA')
plt.legend()
plt.xlabel('$d_t$')
plt.ylabel('$P_t$')

# ## 1. Log-utility
#
# The lecture notes show that with log-utility (a CRRA of $1$), the pricing kernel has a closed form expression: $$P^*(d_t) = \frac{d_t}{\vartheta}$$.
#
# We now compare our numerical solution with this analytical expression.

# %%
# Create an economy with log utility and the same dividend process from before
logUtilEcon = LucasEconomy(CRRA = 1, DiscFac = Disc, DivProcess = DivProc)
# Solve it
logUtilEcon.solve()

# Generate a function with our analytical solution
theta = 1/Disc - 1
aSol = lambda d: d/theta

# Get a grid for d over which to compare them
dGrid = np.exp(DivProc.getLogdGrid())

# Plot both
plt.plot(dGrid, aSol(dGrid), '*',label = 'Analytical solution')
plt.plot(dGrid, logUtilEcon.EqPfun(dGrid), label = 'Numerical solution')
plt.legend()
plt.xlabel('$d_t$')
plt.ylabel('$P^*(d_t)$')

# %% [markdown]
#  ## 2. I.I.D dividends
#  
#  We also found that, if $\ln d_{t+n}\sim \mathcal{N}(-\sigma^2/2, \sigma^2)$ for all $n$, the pricing kernel can me approximated by
#  \begin{equation*}
#  P^*(d_t)\approx \frac{d_t^\rho}{\vartheta - \rho(\rho-1)\sigma^2/2}.
#  \end{equation*}
#  We now test this approximation.

# %%
# Create an i.i.d dividend process
shock_sd = 0.1
iidDivs = DivProcess(alpha = 0.0, shock_mean = -shock_sd**2/2, shock_sd = shock_sd)

# And an economy that embeds it
CRRA = 2
Disc = 0.9

iidEcon = LucasEconomy(CRRA = CRRA, DiscFac = Disc, DivProcess = iidDivs)
iidEcon.solve()

# Generate a function with our analytical solution
theta = 1/Disc - 1
aSolIID = lambda d: d**CRRA/(theta - CRRA*(CRRA-1)*shock_sd**2/2)

# Get a grid for d over which to compare them
dGrid = np.exp(iidDivs.getLogdGrid())
